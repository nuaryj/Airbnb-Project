## New York Airbnb Analysis

Airbnb is a popular platform for people who want to travel and stay in a comfortable and affordable place. In this data analysis project, we will be exploring the Airbnb listings in New York City. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The code is available in the `airbnb.ipynb` file. 

## Loan Prediction

The goal of this project is to find out how different features influence the model prediction and how specific attributes affect the decision more than the other features. It includes building a prepocessing and predictive model. The code is available in the `Loan Prediction.ipynb` file.

## Correlation Analysis

The goal of this project is to explore the data and use correlation analysis to understand the relationships between the variables. We will also be using visualization tools such as scatter plots and heatmaps to help us interpret the results. The code is available in the `correlation-analysis-movies.ipynb` file.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and my ability to apply various techniques and tools to gain insights from different types of data. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!
