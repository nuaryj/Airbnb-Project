## Theme Park Communication Pattern
The display of Scott Jonesâ€™s soccer memorabilia in the Creighton Pavilion at DinoFun World was vandalized. A number of the items of memorabilia had been damaged or had been defaced with black spray paint. Spray paint had been used to write derogatory statements about Scott Jones on the display and throughout the Pavilion. Our goal is to determine the patterns within the communication data to determine when this crime occurred. The code is available in the `Communication pattern.pdf` file. 

## New York Airbnb Analysis

Airbnb is a popular platform for people who want to travel and stay in a comfortable and affordable place. In this data analysis project, we will be exploring Airbnb listings in New York City. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The code is available in the `airbnb.ipynb` file. 

## Loan Prediction

This project aims to find out how different features influence the model prediction and how specific attributes affect the decision more than the other features. It includes building a preprocessing and predictive model. The code is available in the `Loan Prediction.ipynb` file.

## Correlation Analysis

This project aims to explore the data and use correlation analysis to understand the relationships between the variables. We will also be using visualization tools such as scatter plots and heatmaps to help us interpret the results. The code is available in the `correlation-analysis-movies.ipynb` file.

## Infusion Center Analysis
This project aims to analyze issues within the data set through preprocessing and finally calculate wait times between each step within the infusion center. The code is available in the `Infusion Center Analysis.ipynb` file. The PowerPoint that overviews the finding can be located in the 'Infusion Center Analysis.pdf' file.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and ability to apply various techniques and tools to gain insights from different data types. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!
