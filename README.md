Our analysis shows that, on average, Staten Island has the highest
number of available listings despite having the lowest total number of
listings. Meanwhile, Brooklyn typically has the lowest number of
available listings despite having the second-highest total number of
listings. The majority of the rooms available are private or entire
home/apartment. Staten Island typically has a higher average review
rate, while Brooklyn and Manhattan have lower average review rates.
Prices do not appear to vary with room type, and price should be a good
indicator of service fees. The "word map" shows that "smoking," "pet,"
"rules," "don't," and "respectful/respect" are the most frequently
mentioned words in the rules made by hosts.
